# COVID-19 Dashboard

I've been wanting to learn how to use [d3](https://d3js.org/) for a *long* time, so oneday I decided I'd just do it. I needed some data to display so I decided I'd use the suitably named [covid19api](https://covid19api.com/).

Other than that I decided I didn't want to add any other dependencies, so no React this time!

## Setup

This project uses `npm` for package management. You can run `npm install` from the project's root to install dependencies. The project can be 'run' by opening index.html in a web browser.
