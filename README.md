# COVID-19 Dashboard

I've been wanting to learn how to use [d3](https://d3js.org/) for a *long* time, so oneday (26/08/2020) I decided I'd just do it. I needed some data to display so I decided I'd use the suitably named [covid19api](https://covid19api.com/).

Other than that I decided I wanted to keep this project 'vanilla', so no other dependencies!

## Setup

The project can be 'run' by opening index.html in a web browser.
